## **Version Control and Branching Strategy**

- **Main Branch**: Stable code.
- **Develop Branch**: Latest development code.
- **Feature Branches**: For new features (`feature/aws-integration`).

---

## **Issue Tracking and Project Management**

Use GitHub Issues and Projects to:

- **Create Issues**: For tasks and bugs.
- **Project Board**: To track progress using Kanban boards.
- **Milestones**: Align with phases in your PRD.

---

## **Additional Recommendations**

### **1. Code Quality**

- **ESLint and Prettier**: Ensure code consistency.

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev eslint prettier eslint-plugin-react eslint-config-prettier
  ```
